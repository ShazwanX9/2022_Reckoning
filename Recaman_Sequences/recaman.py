"""
In mathematics and computer science,
The Recam치n's sequence (or Recaman's sequence)
Is a well known sequence defined by a recurrence relation,
Because its elements are related to the previous elements in a straightforward way,
They are often defined using recursion. 

Recam치n's sequence (or Recaman's sequence): 
    recaman(0) = 0; 
    for n > 0, 
        if nonnegative and not already in the sequence, 
            recaman(n) = recaman(n-1) - n 
        otherwise 
            recaman(n) = recaman(n-1) + n.
