# Goldbach's Conjecture

___
Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known 
unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. 
It states that every even natural number greater than 2 
is the sum of two prime numbers. 

Goldbach's conjecture: 
    if n%2, 
        return [] 
    otherwise, 
        [prime_min, prime_max]; # prime_min + prime_max = n
___

    Required:
        :param n:   -> int  - the nth to be tested

    Example:
        check_goldbach(2) => []
        check_goldbach(4) => [2,2]
